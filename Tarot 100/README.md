# Tarot for the TRS-80 Model 100, 102, and compatible.

In studying programmer and hobbyist magazines from the 70s and 80s, I noticed that just about every 8- and 16-bit computer had some kind of Tarot program written for it.  Except for the Model 100.  

     Considering how small and simple such a program essentially is, I figured that, while twenty years too late, it still wouldn't hurt to have a Tarot-reading program on a computer that's sized almost ideally for such things.
