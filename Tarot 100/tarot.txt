Tarot Spreads 2005
by Josef Chessor

For the TRS-80 Model 100 Portable Computer

Introduction

     In studying programmer and hobbyist magazines from the 70s and 80s, I noticed that just about every 8- and 16-bit computer had some kind of Tarot program written for it.  Except for the Model 100.  

     Considering how small and simple such a program essentially is, I figured that, while twenty years too late, it still wouldn't hurt to have a Tarot-reading program on a computer that's sized almost ideally for such things.

     This document won't go into any nontechnical aspects of the Tarot deck.  It simply tells you what the options are, and what they do.  Further, the program is considered public domain.  Do with it what you like.

Installation

     Simply type the program in, or if you're more technically inclined, download it onto the Model 100 with a serial cable and use BASIC to turn the .DO file into an executable .BA file.

Usage

     There are three main menu options:

     Celtic Cross - Shuffles the deck and lays the cards out in the classic ten-card cross pattern.

     Star Gate - Much the same, only the ten cards are laid out differently.

     Menu - Return to the Model 100's main menu.

     Cards are shown in an abbreviated form.  The minor arcana are shown with their designation (A through 10, P through K) and their suit.  Major arcana have their whole names abbreviated.  See the end of the file for a complete list of major and minor arcana abbreviations.  A card that is inverted is shown with inverse video attributes.

     After the cards on either layout are shuffled, the screen will show the cards, and two options:  Save, and Back.  

     Back is pretty self-explanatory.  It returns the user to the program's main menu.

     Save prompts for a filename, to save the spread's content to a file in memory.  Here is a sample saved spread:

Modification

     The program's headings and screen layouts are performed all through items contained in the DATA statements in the rear.  Two series of ten numbers denote the PRINT@ locations of each card.  Two series of ten strings denote the output text for each position in a saved spread.  

     Modifying the program is a simple task, provided you get the screen locations right.

I hope you enjoy this program!
